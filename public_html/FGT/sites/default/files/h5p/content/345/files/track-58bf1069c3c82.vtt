00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Water

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.180
Did you know that the human body is about
60% water? So taking in all those other essential

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.400
nutrients won’t sustain us without water’s
help. That’s because every cell in the body

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.000
depends on water, it carries nutrients to
our cells and helps flush out toxins from

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.240
our organs. Drinking water restores fluids
lost through metabolism, breathing, sweating,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.760
and the removal of waste.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.960
It’s important to drink water before you
feel thirsty. That’s because thirst is often

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.320
the first symptom of dehydration. So if you’re
feeling thirsty, you’re probably already

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.080
dehydrated. If it’s hot outside, or you’ve
been exercising, you’ll want to increase

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.120
your water intake.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.640
And what about the opposite, drinking too
much? You may have seen stories in the news

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.680
about marathon runners and over-hydration.
However, this is pretty uncommon; drinking

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.640
too little water is more of a worry. The key
to hydration is to focus on moderation.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.540
Here’s a question my patients ask me all
the time: “How much water should I drink

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.300
each day?” Eight glasses a day isn’t the
magic number; there’s no scientific evidence

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.300
behind it. Recommendations vary anywhere from
8 to 15, 8-ounce glasses of water a day. How

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.340
much water you need depends on a number of
things, like how big you are, your activity

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.920
level, how hot it is…if you’re at all
concerned, talk to a doctor or nutritionist

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.620
about your particular needs.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.800
Most people get about 80% of their water from
liquid and 20% from the food they eat. Foods

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.100
that have a high water content include lettuce,
watermelon, broccoli and grapefruit. They’re

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.560
all are over 90% water. Carrots, apples, yogurt
also contain a lot of water. And of course,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.640
liquids such as milk and fruit juice, and
even herbal teas, will help keep you hydrated.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.140
Plain water is simply the best calorie-free
beverage. If you want to add some flavor,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.020
just add a squeeze of lemon or lime or a splash of 100% fruit juice. Sparkling water is also

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.520
an option for a bit of zing. And filtered
water from the tap is a convenient and cost-effective

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.300
thirst quencher. So drink up!
