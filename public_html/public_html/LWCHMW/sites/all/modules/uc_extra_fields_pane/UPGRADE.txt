UPGRADE TO 6.x-2.x FIRST
------------------------
You first need to upgrade to Extra Fields Pane 6.x-2.0-alpha1 or later,
before upgrading to Extra Fields Pane 7.x-1.x.

The upgrade script to 7.x-1.x only updates the module weight of Extra
Fields Pane to make sure code is executed after Ubercart Addresses code.
There were no schema changes between the 6.x-2.0-alpha1 and 7.x-1.x
version.
